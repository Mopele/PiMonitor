# PiMonitor
A Flask-Webside with Bokeh Plots to display the RaspberryPi's Perfromance! Written in python3

## How to install it
You should use it in a virtual enviroment. For that use `python3 venv venv` in the cloned directory. Then you have to install all the modules. For that you have to activate the virtualenviroment with `source venv/bin/activate`. This lets you use your own independent python3 runtime. Now you have to install all the modules with pip as followed:

```
pip3 install Flask==1.1.2
pip3 install regex==2020.6.7
pip3 install termcolor==1.1.0

pip3 install bokeh==1.4.0
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install psutil
```
